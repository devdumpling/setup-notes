# setup-notes

A repo for taking notes while I tinker with my setup

# arch / EOS

alright, while i'm setting up emacs I need a place to write some notes... normally I would do that in obsidian or emacs

however, since I don't have those, i'm just throwing them in a nice raw github repo

anyway, let's quickly take stock of where we're at

We've:
- purchased a framework 13 laptop and built it
- installed endeavourOS
- gone through basic setup
- installed a few apps (firefox developer edition, wezterm, kitty, zed)
- installed hyprland but haven't set anything up yet

## hyperland

now it's on to figuring out hyprland

"maybe you should stick to plasma... take it slow!" 

yeah but why. i've used linux for going on 20 years in some capacity. sure, i'm an amateur comparatively, but i'm not going to waste my time when i know what i want.
plus, i'm learning. let's get into it. 

(also hyprland hardly seems that difficult... the tutorial is very comprehensive)
